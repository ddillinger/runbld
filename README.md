It wraps!

[![Other Wrappers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Rundmc_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run%E2%80%93D.M.C.)

When you need the power of Jenkins, but the sanity of change
management.

## Usage

Single execution model supported for now, primarily to support
Jenkins's ssh-slaves plugin and default shell build step:

```
runbld /path/to/script.bash
```

## Install

```
% make package
```

Creates a Java binary in `target/` that you can run on OS X, Linux,
and Windows. Distribute to your build slaves as needed. Then, create a
build step in your Jenkins job:

```
#!/path/to/runbld
echo now some bash goes here
echo it does have to be bash for now
exit 0
```

## Example

```
% cat fail.bash 
echo this is gonna fail
exit 1
% runbld ./fail.bash
>>>>>>>>>>>> SCRIPT EXECUTION BEGIN >>>>>>>>>>>>
+ echo this is gonna fail
this is gonna fail
+ exit 1
<<<<<<<<<<<< SCRIPT EXECUTION END   <<<<<<<<<<<<
DURATION: 9ms
WRAPPER: FAILURE (1)
% echo $?
0
%
```


## Development

To see all of the tests passing there are several dependencies that
need to be installed.

### Elasticsearch

Download the latest Elasticsearch from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and start it via
`bin/elasticsearch`.

### facter

`facter` is a command written by Puppet to gather data about the
machine on which it is run.  You have a few options to install this
one.

#### Install the Puppet agent

It is packaged with the puppet agent and Puppet supplies
installers and instructions for various operating systems are at
<https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/>

The direct link for Mac is (as of this writing):
https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/mac/10.13/PC1/x86_64/puppet-agent-latest.dmg

It appears that the `facter` executable will end up in
`/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin` or someplace similar.

#### Build and install manually

The other option you have is to build facter by hand.  It requires
2 other Puppet libraries be installed first.  I built specific
tags in order to get a final bin that was reasonably close to what
we need.  Facter's master branch has bumped the version to `4.0.0`
which is untested and not supported in `runbld` at the moment.

-   <https://github.com/puppetlabs/leatherman> - Tag: 0.11.2
-   <https://github.com/puppetlabs/cpp-hocon> - Tag: 0.1.5
-   <https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter> - Tag: 3.6.4

The instructions in the repos worked reasonably well.  I had one
issue with running `make` in the `facter` repo due to some issue
with copying a ruby file to Mac OS X's default Ruby location.  I
failed to figure out why and eventually worked around it by
removing the Ruby deploy directives from the cmake files.


## Running tests

`lein test` to run the tests and `lein tests!` to clean and test.


## Building the Junit test output

The files are checked in, but if there is ever a need to rebuild them,
some extra dependencies are necessary.  After they are installed go to
the `runbld` directory and run `make junit`.  This will run a few
sample projects and produce various Maven formatted XML test output
files (some of which will look like failures, but don't panic).

### Java

#### Maven

Install via `apt-get`, `brew`, or whatever package manager your
system uses.  You can also install [manually](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

### Python

#### nose

<http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

### go

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

#### go-junit-report

<https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report>

(Don't forget to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your path.)
